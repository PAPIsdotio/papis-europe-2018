# Call for Proposals — PAPIs Europe (April 5-6, 2018 - London)

PAPIs is the 1st series of international conferences dedicated to **real-world Machine Learning applications**. Previous editions took place in Boston, Sydney, Barcelona, Paris, Valencia, São Paulo, and PAPIs is now coming to London! It brings together engineers, scientists, researchers, hackers and managers (200 attendees per day, over 2 days) who meet to share experiences and discover the latest innovations, techniques and tools to build ML applications. Find out more at [papis.io/europe](http://www.papis.io/europe).

## Key dates

- **January 21** (23:59 GMT): Call for Proposals closes
- **February 5**: Notifications of acceptance/rejection due
- **April 5-6**: Conference takes place in London

This year we'd like to **strongly encourage women to submit proposals**. As a community conference, we think it's important to increase diversity in AI. Applications for funding to reimburse childcare and travel costs will be invited from women and primary carers whose proposals are accepted. We're also looking for [sponsors](http://papis.io/sponsoring) to support our diversity efforts!

## What we're looking for

### Presentations

We welcome technical and non-technical presentations with a practical mindset, on a wide range of experience levels — from beginner-friendly how-tos to cautionary tales to deep dives for experienced professionals. We'd like to hear about:

- Challenges and lessons learnt in integrating ML into various applications/products/processes and new areas; this can include technical and domain-specific challenges, as well as those related to fairness, accountability, transparency, privacy, ethics, etc.
- Failure stories — you aren’t a real ML innovator until you’ve had to deal with massive failure of your ML system!
- Techniques, architectures, infrastructures, pipelines, frameworks, APIs to create or improve intelligent applications (from embedded to web-scale)
- Design of ML-powered products
- Tools to make it easier to integrate ML into real-world products/applications (with demos)
- Exciting and innovative ML use cases
- Hands-on tutorials that teach a specific and valuable skill

We’re looking for a diverse and creative line-up of speakers, preferably with experience in public speaking. We invite them to submit proposals of **20' long,  non-commercial presentations**. _(Note: we also have a very limited number of sponsored speaking slots — [contact us](mailto:sponsoring@papis.io) for more information on how to secure one.)_

### Papers

We welcome technical papers, industrial experience reports, review papers and research papers (not required to be accepted to present, but very much encouraged!). Papers presented at PAPIs are published in [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/).

## Tips and rules

You can tips on how to craft a good proposal, how to submit it, and some rules [here](https://github.com/PAPIsdotio/general/blob/master/cfp-tips-rules.md). We will be receiving several proposals covering the same topics. They will be blind-reviewed by our Program Committee and evaluated on the basis of their novelty and/or significance and/or clarity of presentation. Reading these tips and rules will help you craft a proposal that stands out and increase its chances of getting accepted.

## We’re looking forward to receiving your best proposals!

If you have questions or if you have not heard about the status of your submission, please [contact us](mailto:program-committee-europe-2018@papis.mailclark.ai).
