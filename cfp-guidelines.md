## Overview

### Call for Proposals

We are calling for proposals of non-commercial presentations, contributed by the community. Proposals are peer reviewed by our Program Committee.

This year we are specifically aiming to **increase the number of female speakers from 23% last year to a target of 33%**. Applications for funding to reimburse childcare and travel costs will be invited from women and primary carers whose proposals are accepted.

Please read the guidelines below and click on the Submit button on the right to submit your proposals.

### Call for Sponsors

(Please note that this is separate from the Call for Proposals)

You can secure a speaking slot and a booth in the breakout area by becoming a sponsor. Please see [papis.io/sponsoring](http://www.papis.io/sponsoring) for more information or contact us at [sponsoring@papis.io](mailto:sponsoring@papis.io).

### AI Startup Battle

We are calling for innovative startups that use ML and AI at their core, to compete in our unique startup competition where the jury is an AI.

## About the conference

PAPIs '17 is the 4th International Conference on Predictive Applications and APIs, returning to Boston on October 24-25, 2017 and featuring technical presentations, business talks, hands-on tutorials and demos (tools, use cases).

PAPIs is a series of independent community conferences, dedicated to the application of ML to real-world problems to create intelligent applications. The audience is a mix of developers, software engineers, data scientists, machine learning engineers, researchers, decision makers, managers, strategists and innovators. [Previous PAPIs conferences](http://papis.io/past-events) took place in Boston, Sydney, Barcelona, Paris and Valencia.

> “PAPIs is really about bringing machine learning into use” — Danny Lange, VP of AI and ML at Unity

**Please read these guidelines all the way through** for the best chance of having your proposal selected. If you have questions or concerns about anything you see here, please don’t hesitate to email us at [cfp-boston@papis.mailclark.ai](mailto:cfp-boston@papis.mailclark.ai). We’re looking forward to receiving your best proposals!


<a name="what"></a>
## 1. What we're looking for

Presentations at PAPIs are 20-minute long, plus 5 minutes for Q&A. It may seem like a short time, but it allows for dynamic and focused talks that keep the audience engaged.

We'd like to hear about:

* Exciting and innovative ML use cases
* Challenges and lessons learnt in integrating ML into various applications / processes / businesses and new areas; this can include technical and domain-specific challenges, as well as those related to fairness, accountability, transparency, privacy, etc.
* Techniques, architectures, infrastructures, pipelines, frameworks, API design to create better predictive / intelligent applications (from embedded to web-scale)
* Tools to democratize ML and make it easier to build into products
* Needs, trends, opportunities in this space
* Tutorials that teach a specific and valuable skill

We welcome practical presentations on a wide range of experience levels — from beginner-friendly how-tos to cautionary tales to deep dives for experienced professionals. We’re looking for a diverse and creative line-up of speakers, preferably with experience in public speaking.


<a name="how"></a>
## 2. How do I write a good proposal?

We will be receiving several proposals covering the same topics. They will be evaluated by our Program Committee on the basis of their novelty and/or significance and/or clarity of presentation. Reading the following will help you craft a proposal that stands out.

Attendees have different levels of experience — from totally new to very experienced. Start by identifying your main audience and the level of your talk. Your presentation should either directly help them, or inspire/inform them about something they don’t already know. The core value to our attendees of what you’re presenting should be clearly stated in your proposal. What will they be able to do after they see your presentation that they can’t do now?

We believe that great presentations should be practical and focused. For instance, instead of presenting something general or showing a portfolio of things you / your company have done, it’s better to show one specific, unique thing in enough detail.

A few more remarks:

* Screenshots and live demos are very much appreciated. They help make your presentation more concrete and engaging.
* If your presentation is centered on a particular commercial tool or product, we may only accept it as a sponsored presentation. See the FAQ for details and don't hesitate to contact us directly.
* Here are examples of some of the most popular presentations at previous conferences:
	* Business and introductory presentations:
		* [Big Wins with Small Data](http://lanyrd.com/2015/papis2015/sdpcdh/)
		* [Business reasons for automating decisions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKQJAu6k7pQ)
	* Advanced presentations:
		* [Scaling Machine Learning as a Service](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/li17a/li17a.pdf)
		* [Protocols and Structures for Inference (research paper)](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v50/montgomery15.pdf)
	* Hands-on technical presentations:
		* [PredictionIO tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeGnILRIdUk&list=PLex5Agivp-gh3tYo9yCY9Dgcj3nXYol1k&index=13)
		* [End to End Machine Learning with MLDB.ai (sponsored)](https://twitter.com/mldbai/status/786230824727445504)

## 3. Filling in the proposal form

Our proposal form has two fields that attendees will see on the program (title and abstract), and two fields that only reviewers will see (details and pitch). Please also use tags for reviewers to identify the type of proposal you’re submitting. It is possible to submit several proposals through our CfP application. Note that we have a policy of not having more than 2 talks from speakers from the same company, in an effort to promote different approaches to ML applications at the conference.

### Title, Abstract & Bio

These are what attendees will see in the program. Title and abstract should be compelling and to-the-point. Tell a story. Why should attendees come to your presentation and what will they get out of it?

Your bio won’t be seen by reviewers in the 1st round of reviews but we will use it when advertising your presentation if it is accepted. Please include your current position and organization.

### Details

Only reviewers will see this. Please take care here to refrain from identifying who you are since our first round of review is blind, and we appreciate your efforts to respect that as much as possible.

Details is a good place to go into more depth about what you’ll cover and to be as specific as possible on the content of your presentation. We invite you to...

* include an outline
* reveal the secret sauce of your presentation
* explain any twists you’ll include that may not be evident in the title or abstract.

Please also let us know... 

* if you intend to include a live demo or live coding (and intended duration)
* the main audience for your talk (see "About the conference" section above).

### Pitch

Only reviewers will see this. Pitch is a good place to tell reviewers why PAPIs needs this presentation, and why you’re the right person to give it at PAPIs. How will your presentation help the program, or fill a specific need? Why are you excited about this topic?

### Tags

Please assign multiple tags to help us identify how technical your presentation will be (Non-Technical, Somewhat Technical, Mostly Technical) and the required ML knowledge (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

### Industrial experience reports, research papers and review papers

Attaching a report or paper to your proposal is optional but it's a huge plus for getting it accepted. We will also publish final accepted papers in our proceedings in the Journal of Machine Learning Research (see our [2016](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v67/) and [2015 proceedings](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v50/) as an example).

- In addition to submitting the proposal form, please also send one of the following (anonymized) documents via this [upload form](https://papisdotio.wufoo.com/forms/xst26ab1dgwqty/), in PDF format and using the [JMLR style](http://www.jmlr.org/format/format.html):
	- an extended abstract of 2 pages or more (references and comparisons to related work should be included, but details of implementation can be omitted)
	- OR a short paper of 4 pages
	- OR a long paper of up to 8 pages
- Please make sure the PDF file has the same name as your proposal title.

### Thanks for submitting a proposal to PAPIs '17! Good luck!
